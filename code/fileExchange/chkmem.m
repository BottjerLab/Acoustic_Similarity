function chkmem
% CHKMEM
% This utility measures the size of the largest contiguous block of virtual
% memory available to MATLAB, then recommends solutions to increase its
% size should it be smaller than typical. This is only for the diagnosis of
% memory fragmentation problems just after MATLAB startup.
%
% The recommended solutions can help to reduce the occurence of "Out of Memory"
% errors. See MEMORY function in MATLAB 7.6 and later.
%
% Example:
% chkmem
% MATLAB Memory Fragmentation Detection Utility
% ---------------------------------------------
% Measurement of largest block size:
%   Largest free block is 1157MB, which is close to typical (1200MB) but less than
%   best case (1500MB), therefore, its size **CAN BE INCREASED** and may reduce the
%   occurrence of "Out of Memory" errors if you are experiencing them.
%
% Possible software modules fragmenting MATLAB's memory space:
%  c:\winnt\system32\uxtheme.dll
%
% Recommendations to increase size of largest block:
% * The location of uxtheme.dll may be causing problems. Consider solution 1-1HE4G5,
%   which rebases a group of Windows DLLs. This has some known side effects which you
%   should consider. If you choose to make the changes, restart MATLAB and run
%   this utility again.
% * If the list of software modules above includes DLLs located in the MATLAB
%   installation directory, check your startup.m or matlabrc.m files to see if
%   they are running code that is not essential.
% * If the list of software modules above includes DLLs from applications other than
%   Windows or MATLAB, consider uninstalling the application if it is not essential,
%   then restart MATLAB and run this utility again. A tool such as Process Explorer
%   can help identify the source and manufacturer of DLLs MATLAB is using. You could
%   also contact the software manufacturer to ask if the DLL can be safely rebased.
%
% 3GB switch status:
%   The MATLAB process limit has been detected as is 3071MB, therefore the 3GB switch
%   in your system's boot.ini is SET.
