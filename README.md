# Acoustic Similarity

* Brief (one paragraph) project description goes here - TBD

### Prerequisites

1. MATLAB R2013a or higher.

### Installation

1. Download the package by cloning this repository.
2. Open MATLAB, navigate to the download location, and add the root folder of the repository + all subfolders to the MATLAB path.

## Example Usage

You can segment syllables, perform clustering on syllables, or calculate tutor similarity using the provided functions. An example workflow is given below utilizing a sample data file that has been given.

1. Open MATLAB, and run segmentAndCluster.m, located in Acoustic_Similarity/workflow.
2. When prompted, select the example data file - Acoustic_Similarity/data/Gy242/Gy242_08_31_039.mat
3. As the script runs, check its progress and follow the onscreen prompts as they appear. <br>Important:<br> Variables that the script prompts you to save must be saved in the same directory as the original data file (e.g. Acoustic_Similarity/data/Gy242).
4. (Instructions to run compareTutorJuvenile.m will go here. Need to check with John first to ensure all the inputs to the script have been generated.)
